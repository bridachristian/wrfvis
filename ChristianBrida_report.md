### Introduction
In this project my task is to develop a Skew T-LogP plot, based on WRF model.
The user can select a specif point over an area, providing longitude and latitude in WGS84 projection, and selecting a specific timestamp. The main feature allows to plot the Skwe T-logP plot for the location and for the time selected. It also obtain information about wind profile in terms of wind speed and wind direction and the hodograph, a plot that provide information in vectorial form of wind over the entire vertical profile.
Based on basic Skew T-logP diagram I develop another function that allow the user to compare 2 different timestamps and evaluate the variation during the selected period. In this case. the user indicate the coordinates of a point, a timestamp and also a delta time respect to the initial timestamp. 

### Project Development

- Plot wind profile
- Plot hodograph
- Derivation of Skew T-LogP paramters
- Skew T-LogP comparison and average
#### User interface
- Development of html webpage
- Development of user input
#### Test
